# SUMMARY
Just a modified script of Kripthor's ESP8266-WifiBeaconJam to send words as SSIDs.
https://github.com/kripthor/WiFiBeaconJam/blob/master/WiFiBeaconJam.ino

# Description
This noob project is a modified version from kripthor's WifiBeaconJam. I extended the SSID length to 14 Characters. The script takes a text which is separated by spaces. The words must have a max length of 10 characters. The result depends on the used devices and their wifi. Change line 74 to increase or decrease packets for one word.
